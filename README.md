**Boost your productivity by implementing best practices for automating repetitive desktop processes**

## What is this book about?
Whether you want to organize simple files, perform more complex consolidations between different Office programs, or remote-control applications that don't allow outside access, Power Automate Desktop helps meet these challenges.
In this book, the underlying concept of RPA is introduced step by step. You start with very simple flows that can be easily recorded and further processed with the built-in recorder. Afterward, more advanced actions are used to automate folder and file management and, for example, to let the Office programs interact with each other. After this, you will learn how Desktop Flows can be integrated into other cloud environments and how even more value can be added by using AI. Additionally, you will learn how Flows can run unattended and how they are managed in the Power Platform and other necessary concepts such as creating, modifying, debugging, and error-handling UI flows. Finally, you will learn how to use PAD in conjunction with their most used desktop systems to automate routine tasks.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Master RPA with Power Automate Desktop to commence your debut flow
* Grasp all essential product concepts such as UI flow creation and modification, debugging, and error handling
* Use PAD to automate tasks in conjunction with the frequently used systems on your desktop
* Attain proficiency in configuring flows that run unattended to achieve seamless automation
* Discover how to use AI to enrich your flows with insights from different AI models
* Explore how to integrate a flow in a broader cloud context
